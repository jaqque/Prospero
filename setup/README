Welcome,

This directory has changed slightly. The new format allows for
each type of database to have its own schema. The following
directories are included:

	mysql/		-- Schema for the popular MySQL
	sqlite/		-- Schema for v2 or v3 of SQLite
	sqlite2/	-- Schema for specifically v2 of SQLite
	pgsql/		-- Schema for PostgreSQL

Also, the included setup.pl has been modified to work with
all of the above types of databases. (FIXME: actually, only
MySQL until I actually change it)

To automate the setup of your database and user, type:

	cd ~/infobotdir
	./setup/setup.pl

(NOTE: The setup will ask for an account capable of administrating
the database server!)

# vim:ts=4:sw=4:expandtab:tw=80
