                           --------------------------

This file contains some general guidelines for installing infobot on your
system. At this point it is very basic, but should hopefully clear up some of
your confusion.

Configuration:

    - Copy files/sample/* to files/

    - Edit files/infobot.config, modify to taste.
    - Edit files/infobot.servers to modify list of IRC servers to connect.
    - Edit files/infobot.chan to set which channels to join.

Required Perl modules:

    - Net::IRC perl module
        - Debian: (apt-get install libnet-irc-perl)
    - WWW::Search
        - Debian: (apt-get install libwww-search-perl)
    - LWP
        - Debian: (apt-get install libwww-perl)
    - HTML::Parser
        - Debian: (apt-get install libhtml-parser-perl)
    - XML::Feed
        - Debian: (apt-get install libxml-feed-perl)

Choose your database:
	- MySQL, read the section MySQL below
	- SQLite or SQLite2, read the section SQLite below
	- PgSQL, read the section PostgreSQL below

NOTE: There are "bugs" in the perl modules.  Read the section "Patches" below, on how to fix.

Finally, start your bot by changing to the base dir and type:

    ./infobot



                                ----------------
                                -- PostgreSQL --
                                ----------------

- Debian: (apt-get install postgresql)
- Debian: (apt-get install libpg-perl)


As of now, infobot has full pgsql support. It seems to be working 100%, but it
assumes that you have precreated the database and user for now. As long as you
already created the database and user and stored this info in the
infobot.config, then the tables will automatically be created on startup. Until
I get setup.pl fixed, run the following commands as root (or postgres if root
doesnt have permission to create users/db's):

    > createuser --no-adduser --no-createdb --pwprompt --encrypted <user>
    > createdb --owner=<user> <dbname> [<description>]

Dont forget to replace <user> and so forth with actual values you intend to use,
and dont include the <>'s ;) If you run these commands, you should get a user
with an encrypted password that cannot create new db's or user's (as it should
be!), and the user will own the newly created database <dbname>. Congrats!

If everything went fine, you should have everything infobot needs to use pgsql.
Next simply cd to the base directory you installed the bot to and type:

    ./infobot


Thats it! Everything the bot needs should be automatically created when it loads
for the first time.

In the future I will try to get around to editing the setup.pl file to ask the
same questions it does for mysql (your root password etc) so that you can skip
manually creating the database/user. But for now, this should be just fine for
most of you techies out there.




                                  -----------
                                  -- MySQL --
                                  -----------

- Install a MySQL server and the DBI Perl modules.
    - Debian: (apt-get install mysql-server libdbd-mysql-perl)

- Run 'mysqladmin -u root -p create <DB NAME>'
    Where <DB NAME> is the same as specified in infobot.config.

- Run 'setup/setup.pl'
    FIXME: This script is horribly broken! Do NOT use it! The bot will
    automatically create the tables when it starts. You just need to ensure that
    the database and the login information are correct, and start the bot.

Possible problems
-----------------
    - if connection to localhost is (short) refused, run
	    '/etc/init.d/mysql stop'
	    '/etc/init.d/mysql start'
    - if connection for user is refused, reload grant tables with
	    'mysqladmin -u root -p reload'

* [OPTIONAL]
    - run 'scripts/dbm2mysql.pl old-db' to convert dbm database file
    to mysql.


ADDITIONAL NOTES
----------------
You can add a new user manually by connecting to MySQL and performing these
commands:

  $ mysql -u root -p

  mysql> CREATE DATABASE infobot;
  mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
  mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON infobot.* TO 'user'@'localhost';

FULL FACTOID DATABASE
---------------------
You can get the data from the MySQL database that the apt bot uses on
#debian at freenode (irc.freenode.net), at:

    http://lain.cheme.cmu.edu/~apt/infobot/apt.sql.bz2




                                  ------------
                                  -- SQLite --
                                  ------------

SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access without
running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a standalone
command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to administer an SQLite
database and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.

infobot will create a file called <DBname>.sqlite and populate the tables for
you if they do not already exist.

- Install SQLite libraries and DBI Perl modules.
    - Debian: (apt-get install libsqlite0 libdbd-sqlite-perl)

other distros might need to build from sources.

You may use either DBD::SQLite or DBD::SQLite2

SQLite sources:

    http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/

DBD::SQLite sources:

    http://search.cpan.org/author/MSERGEANT/DBD-SQLite/

You will also need the normal Perl DBD stuff which should be included in your
Perl distribution.
