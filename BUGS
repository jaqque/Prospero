Known bugs that should be dealt with soon as possible:

    * Multiple nick per server is in need of some testing and make be
    incomplete or buggy in some parts of the bot

    * Older CMD: foo's cannot be used or removed. Must be removed manually from
    the database with SQL

    * !+topic list gives and incorrect error Failed. "You (#botpark) are not in
    #botpark, hey?"

    * News is currently stored in a file rather than the SQL table created for it

    * !help has size issues. Add's extra lines with only 1 or 2 help commands
    instead of one maximum size IRC msg

    * Bot can be flooded offline with a crash if !+factstats help and /msg nick
    factstats help, are used at the same time

    * Wildcards in --HOSTS section has problems.
    eg: nick!*@foo.*.someisp.com doesnt recognize for removing factoids but:
    nick!foobar@*.someisp.com does
